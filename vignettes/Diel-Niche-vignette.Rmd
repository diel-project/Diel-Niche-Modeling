# Introducion
The Diel.Niche R pacakge is setup to evaluate how animals use the three fundamental light periods of twilight (dawn & dusk), daytime, and nighttime. First, we need to install and load the library
```{r package}
#devtools::install_github("diel-project/Diel-Niche-Modeling",ref="main")

library(Diel.Niche)
```

To learn some basic information about the diel hypotheses you can call
```{r hyp}
  what.hyp()
```

If you just need to remember the names of the hypotheses you can call
```{r hyp2}
  what.hyp("?")
```

Lastly, a description for a specific hypothesis can also be called
```{r hyp3}
  what.hyp("D.max")
```

# Simulate Data
To simulate data based on a diel hypotheses, we need define a hypothesis using it's coded name. Pick a hypothesis to simulate data from  
```{r sim1}
  hyp=c("N.th")
```

There are hypotheses already setup as multinomial models with inequality constraints. These defaults are, 

```{r sim2}
    diel.setup=diel.ineq()
```
If you want to specify your own hypotheses, such as defining the lower threshold of a Nocturnal hypotheses, you could set up the lower threshold value as
```{r sim3}
  #The first element is the lower threshold relevant to the   threshold models and the second element is the most likely value, which is not relevent for the model chossen.
    diel.setup=diel.ineq(xi.N=c(0.7,0.9))
```

Then we simulate data as
```{r sim4}
  set.seed(45451)
  sim.dat=sim.diel(n.sim=1,n.sample=100,hyp=hyp)
  y=sim.dat$y
  y
```

# Setup hypotheses set and fit models

You can setup your own model set or use pre-defined model sets as
```{r hyp.set}
  hyp.set = c("D.max","N.max") #manual
  hyp.set=hyp.sets("hyp.max") #pre-defined
```

Lastly, we fit our models  
```{r fit}
  out = diel.fit(y=y,hyp.set=hyp.set)

```

You can discover the available outputs as

```{r results}
attributes(out)

?diel.hypotheses.func
```

# Plotting

We can plot our most supported models posterior probability distribution a number of ways. Using ggplo2 and bayesplot:

```{r plot}
library(bayesplot)
library(ggplot2)

posteriors=coda::as.mcmc(out$most.supported.model)

plot_title <- ggtitle("Posterior distributions",
                      "with medians and 80% intervals")
mcmc_areas(posteriors, prob = 0.8) + plot_title+ 
  geom_vline(xintercept=sim.dat$p, linetype="dashed", 
                color = c("red","green","purple"), size=1)

```

Another way to examine our hypothesis to plot the theoretical niche space for the hypothesis along with the postesterior samples.

```{r 3dplot}
diel.plot(hyp=out$model.ms,
          diel.setup=diel.setup,
          posteriors=out$most.supported.model)
```
